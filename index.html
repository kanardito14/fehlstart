fehlstart - a small application launcher written in gnu c99

I've written fehlstart because gnome-do and others do way more than what I need.
gnome-do uses mono which I feel requires too much resources to perform a simple
task like application launching. the source is released as GPLv3.

what it does:
 * launch applications
 * global hotkey (win + space)

to-do list:
 * choice learning
 * settings editor
 * simple file search
 * browser search

maybe later:
 * remove gio dependency
 * libpurple/pidgin support
 * simple calculator

requirements:
 * gcc compiler
 * gtk+-2.0 dev package

build instructions:
 * gcc fehlstart.c -o fehlstart -std=gnu99 `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

notes:
 ubuntu: the unity shell already binds the win key
 arch: gtk+ doesn't seem to come with gio

 about 800 lines of c code. I used some gcc and linux specific stuff. the .desktop
 files are read with gio. if you're running on a low-end machine, disabling icons
 will improve performance considerably.
